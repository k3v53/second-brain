They are useful when you want to add different names to the same note, when you do it, at the time of adding a link it appears as the main name, and also the aliases, so you can link with the most according name based on the note context.

Example:

Instead of linking "What is Artificial Inteligence?" on an article, you can use "AI" and in that way, it will be more coherent in the text without disrupting normal reading.
