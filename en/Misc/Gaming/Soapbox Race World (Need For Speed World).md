Soapbox Race World is actually a great racing game that originated after the deprecation of Need For Speed World.
Created as a fan-made project that revives the online racing experience of **Need for Speed: World**. This community-driven initiative allows players to download a launcher and play on multiple servers, each with its own custom economy and content.

Players can enjoy a variety of modifications, from simple lighting changes to entirely new cars, making each server uniqueÂ¹. It's a great way for fans of the original game to relive the excitement and explore new features created by the community.
