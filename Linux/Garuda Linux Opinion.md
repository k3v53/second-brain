I've daily driven Garuda for around one and a half years, had problems and wanted to replace it with [[NixOS]], but here are my toughts:

# Advantages
- Arch Linux Based: Not my favorite but for some people this is great
- Simpler Arch Experience Out of the Box: It includes a lot of pre-installed software that actually helps a lot when you don't want to mess around with config files or the terminal.
- You can Choose the [[Desktop Environment]]: This is a must for me, and luckily every big distro is releasing with [[Gnome]] and [[KDE Plasma]] out of the box!

# Disadvantages

- It is a bit unstable
- Installing software that is not on the tools is painful for a newbie

# Why I distro Hopped From It?
I had problems with steam in the latest releases around September of 2024, problems with [[BTRFS]] having weird folders that I cannot delete (I don't think that is garuda's fault but happened), also updates were weirdly stalled, tried deleting cache, refreshing mirrors and a lot more, didn't work.
Later on I wanted to try [[NixOS]] because I've found out that it will help my messy dotfiles git repo transform in something more organized.
