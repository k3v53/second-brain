Linux mint was one of the first [[Linux Distros]] that I've really enjoyed using, is easy to use, easy to install and easy to understand, The only downside I've could find is the UI, Cinnamon is not very _Aesthetic_ in my opinion and feels a little old.
# Advantages
- Ease of Use
- Easy Installation
- Easy Upgradability
- One of the biggest communities that I've ever seen in a distro, almost behind [[Ubuntu]]
- Doesn't directly depend on [[Ubuntu]]
- 
# Disadvantages
- UI that feels a little outdated
- Customization of Cinnamon is behind KDE or Gnome
- Comes with a lot of pre-installed software

For newbies, this is the best one so far that I've daily driven myself and is worth starting from here!
