This wiki is a plain and simple dump of a bunch of random information that I've found talking with someone, searching in the web or concluded after investigating some topic, and when I'm advancing in something complex that nobody treated after I try to investigate and later on write a well documented guide or article in here for the future me or for some unfortunate pal that is looking for a solution to the same problem.
I have plans on making knowledge gardens some time but for now on I will drop everything here until I have time to organize my ideas into different gardens.
